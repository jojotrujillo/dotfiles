[ThePrimeagen/dev](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/dev): ThePrimeagen's GitHub repo for his own dev setup that I'm mirroring.

[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/): A lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.

[Hyprland](https://hypr.land/): Hyprland is an independent tiling Wayland compositor written in C++. Noteworthy features of Hyprland include dynamic tiling, tabbed windows, a clean and readable C++ code-base, and a custom renderer that provides window animations, rounded corners, and Dual-Kawase Blur on transparent windows.

[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar): See https://wiki.hypr.land/Useful-Utilities/Status-Bars/#waybar for more info on Hyprland integration. Waybar is a GTK status bar made specifically for wlroots compositors and supports Hyprland by default. To use it, it’s recommended to use your distro’s package.

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/): Ghostty is a terminal emulator that differentiates itself by being fast, feature-rich, and native. While there are many excellent terminal emulators available, they all force you to choose between speed, features, or native UIs. Ghostty provides all three.

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/): Bash is the GNU Project's shell—the Bourne Again SHell. This is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh).

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki): tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.

[neovim](https://neovim.io/): Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim.
